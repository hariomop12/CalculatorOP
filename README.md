## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
The application follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and ease of testing.

- **Model**: Handles data operations, including interaction with Room Database and network calls using Retrofit.
- **View**: Built with Jetpack Compose, the view layer displays the UI and observes the ViewModel for data changes.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, managing UI-related data and handling user actions.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Kotlin**: The official programming language for Android.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native UI.
